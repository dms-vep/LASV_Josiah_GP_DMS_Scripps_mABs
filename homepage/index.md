## About this site
This website contains interactive plots and numerical results from a study that measures the effects of mutations to the glycoprotein complex (GPC) of the lineage IV Lassa virus Josiah strain on antibody escape for a panel of monoclonal antibodies using [pseudovirus deep mutational scanning](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.05.579020v1). This study is in collaboration with the [Briney](https://brineylab.com/) and [Ward](https://ward.scripps.edu/) labs at [Scripps Research](https://www.scripps.edu/). Deep mutational scanning was carried out by Caleb Carr in the Bloom lab.
