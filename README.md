# Deep mutational scanning of Lassa virus Josiah strain glycoprotein and mapping monoclonal antibodies from Scripps Research Institute using a barcoded lentiviral platform

Study by Caleb Carr and Jesse Bloom.

This repo contains data for deep mutational scanning of Lassa virus Josiah strain glycoprotein with an emphasis on antibody escape mapping for monoclonal antibodies from Scripps Research Institute. 

For documentation of the analysis, see [https://dms-vep.github.io/LASV_Josiah_GP_DMS_Scripps_mABs/](https://dms-vep.github.io/LASV_Josiah_GP_DMS_Scripps_mABs/)

Antibodies mapped in this repo include:
- S437.8
- S437.11 
- S437.20
- S437.27
- S437.42
- S444.28
- S444.33
- S444.46
- S444.78
- S437.52 ***Non-neutralizing antibody***

## Organization of this repo

### `dms-vep-pipeline-3` submodule

Most of the analysis is done by the [dms-vep-pipeline-3](https://github.com/dms-vep/dms-vep-pipeline-3), which was added as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to this pipeline via:

    git submodule add https://github.com/dms-vep/dms-vep-pipeline-3

This added the file [.gitmodules](.gitmodules) and the submodule [dms-vep-pipeline-3](https://github.com/dms-vep/dms-vep-pipeline-3), which was then committed to the repo.
Note that if you want a specific commit or tag of [dms-vep-pipeline-3](https://github.com/dms-vep/dms-vep-pipeline-3) or to update to a new commit, follow the [steps here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10916398), basically:

    cd dms-vep-pipeline-3
    git checkout <commit>

and then `cd ../` back to the top-level directory, and add and commit the updated `dms-vep-pipeline-3` submodule.
You can also make changes to the [dms-vep-pipeline-3](https://github.com/dms-vep/dms-vep-pipeline-3) that you commit back to that repo.

### Code and configuration
The [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/) pipeline itself is run by `dms-vep-pipeline-3/Snakefile` which reads its configuration from [config.yaml](config.yaml).
The [conda](https://docs.conda.io/) environment used by the pipeline is that specified in the `environment.yml` file in [dms-vep-pipeline-3](https://github.com/dms-vep/dms-vep-pipeline-3).

### Input data
Input data for the pipeline are in [./data/](data).

### Results and documentation
The results of running the pipeline are placed in [./results/](results).
Only some of these results are tracked to save space (see [.gitignore](.gitignore)).

The pipeline builds HTML documentation for the pipeline in [./docs/](docs), which is rendered via GitHub Pages at TODO.

## Running the pipeline
To run the pipeline, build the conda environment `dms-vep-pipeline-3` in the `environment.yml` file of [dms-vep-pipeline-3](https://github.com/dms-vep/dms-vep-pipeline-3), activate it, and run [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/), such as:

    conda activate dms-vep-pipeline-3
    snakemake -j 32 --use-conda -s dms-vep-pipeline-3/Snakefile

To run on the Hutch cluster via [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/), you can run the file [run_Hutch_cluster.bash](run_Hutch_cluster.bash):

    sbatch -c 32 run_Hutch_cluster.bash
